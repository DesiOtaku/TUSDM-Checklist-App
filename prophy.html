<p>Pt presents for prophy. Pts medical history was reviewed--no changes.</p>

<p>GOALS: OHI + Prophylaxis</p>

<p>Using disclosing solution/tablets, surfaces exhibiting plaque were recorded and a plaque free score of 85% was calculated.</p>

<p>The patient's homecare (brushing with modified bass technique, flossing technique) was reviewed and appropriately reinforced/modified.  The importance of frequent, thorough and consistent homecare was stressed to ensure a successful outcome of periodontal therapy and to prevent future disease.</p>

<p>Using hand scalers &amp; curettes, all clinically detectable supra and subgingival calculus was removed from all tooth surfaces with as little trauma as possible to the surrounding soft tissues. All surfaces were checked with the explorer to ensure that they were as free of calculus and smooth as possible.</p>

<p>An ultrasonic scaler with the appropriate tips was used to remove as much supra and subgingival calculus as possible. Using hand scalers &amp; curettes, all tooth surfaces were refined with as little trauma as possible to the surrounding soft tissues.  All surfaces were checked with the explorer to ensure that they were as free of calculus and smooth as possible.</p>

<p>All exposed tooth surfaces were polished using prophy paste and a rubber cup with a slow speed handpiece.</p>
