Patient presented to clinic today for SCRP (UR, LR, UL, LL)  Medical History was reviewed and indicated (no)change.<br>
<br>
Med Hx:<br>
CC:<br>

Goals: Remove residual  embedded calculus; remove diseased altered cementum and toxic bacterial products; prepare the root surface for reattachment; create a smooth dentinal surface<br>
<br>
Using disclosing solution/tablets, surfaces exhibiting plaque were recorded and a plaque free score of  __% was calculated.<br>
<br>
The patient's homecare was reviewed and appropriately reinforced/modified.  The importance of frequent, thorough and consistent homecare was stressed to ensure a successful outcome of periodontal therapy and to prevent future disease.<br>
<br>
--- carpule/s of -(Lidocaine 2% (20mg/ml) with 1:100,000 epinephrine (0.01mg/ml) ) -was administered for patient comfort during the procedure.<br>
<br>
Right/Left Maxillary Infiltration, (supplemental palatal injection/incisive canal)<br>
Mandibular block, accessory long buccal nerve block<br>
<br>
An ultrasonic scaler, with the appropriate tip, was used to remove as much supra and subgingival calculus as possible.  Using hand scalers & curettes, all tooth surfaces were refined and planed with as little trauma as possible to the surrounding soft tisssue. All surfaces were checked with the explorer to ensure that they were free of calculus and smooth.  If previous areas were treated, they were evaluated and if necessary, the scaling and root planing was refined.<br>
<br>
All exposed tooth surfaces were polished using prophy paste and a rubber cup with a slow speed hanpiece.<br>
